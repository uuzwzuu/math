Winnie should win \$27. 

\begin{proof}
Winnie's strategy is to put the greatest card available to the pile that has the greater sum. Assuming the two piles are pile $A$ and pile $B$, and  Grogg places the first card with number $k$ to pile $A$, the sums of the 2 piles become $k$ and $0$, respectively. Winnie will then place the greatest card available to the same pile $A$ to make the difference larger. To reduce the difference, Grogg has to choose the next greatest card and put it into the other pile $B$. 

Going forward, Winnie chooses the greatest card available and put it into pile $A$, and Grogg puts the next largest card to pile $B$. The game ends when all cards get put into both piles. 

The sum of pile $A$ should always be greater than the sum of pile $B$, since Grogg puts the first card into pile $A$ and in each round afterwards Grogg always puts a smaller card to pile $B$.

To make the difference minimal, Grogg has to choose the smallest card first, e.g. $k=1$. Winnie then chooses  the greatest card with the number 50 and put it into the pile $A$  to make the sum 51. Grogg then chooses the next greatest card with number 49 and put it into pile $B$.

At the end of the game, pile $A$ has all the cards with even numbers and an extra card with number 1. Pile $B$ has all the cards with odd numbers except the card with number 1.

The sum of pile $A$ is $50+48+\cdots +4+2+1=651$, and the sum of pile $B$ is $49+47+\cdots +5+3=624$. The difference is $651-624=27$.

As long as Winnie sticks to her strategy, Grogg has no other strategy to make the difference less than 27.

Therefore, Winnie should win \$27 with the optimal strategy.
